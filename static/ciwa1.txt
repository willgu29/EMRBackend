COMMENTARY:
- CIWA does not have objective measures, in contrast to AWS scale
- Vitals Q4H is not part of order set
  Individually, Priscilla ordered cardiac telemetry and pulse ox
- Exists in CCU Order Set at LBVAMC
- Exists in Quest at UCIMC
- Per Morning Conference at LBVAMC, main barrier is nursing was not trained on implementing CIWA
